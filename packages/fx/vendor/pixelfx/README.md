# pixelfx.

**<!-- count -->232<!-- /count --> pixel art effects and animations, every one a small piece of code.** Fire,
explosions, magic, weather, UI, pickups, critters and more. Play them live, recolor and mirror them, drop them into
a browser game, or export sprite sheets for any engine. Plus a Claude Code skill that makes new ones the way a
picky pixel artist would: draft, render, look, refine.

[make your own](#make-your-own) · [how it works](#how-it-works)

The method is [Hugo Duprez](https://x.com/HugoDuprez)'s, from [How to make (good) pixel art effects with
Claude](https://www.spritefusion.com/blog/how-to-make-good-pixel-art-effects-with-claude): code is clay, trust your
eyes, feed your references. His [open-source effects](https://www.spritefusion.com/pixel-art-vfx) at Sprite Fusion
set the bar, and `src/core/sim.js` and the effects that say so at the top adapt his code. This repo is our take on
the idea at library scale, with a skill to keep going.

<!-- /catalog -->

Every effect is a file in `src/fx/<category>/<name>.js`. The [catalog](docs/CATALOG.md) lists them all.

## use one.

**In a browser game** (canvas, Phaser, PixiJS, Kaplay, three.js), use the code. No dependencies.

```js
import { createFrame, clearFrame, createFx, composite } from "pixelfx";
import * as frostNova from "pixelfx/fx/ice/frost-nova";

const frame = createFrame(320, 180);                   // your game's pixel resolution
const img = new ImageData(320, 180);
const fx = createFx(frostNova, { x: 160, y: 140 });   // also: flip, angle, seed, palette, light...

function tick(dt) {
  fx.update(dt);
  clearFrame(frame);
  fx.draw(frame, "back");                              // behind characters
  drawCharacters();
  fx.draw(frame, "front");
  composite(frame, img.data, backgroundColor);         // color, then light added on top
  ctx.putImageData(img, 0, 0);                         // scale up with image-rendering: pixelated
}
```

Install from GitHub with `npm i github:patch-gg/pixelfx`, or copy `src/core` and the effects you want.

**In any engine** (Godot, Unity, GameMaker, Defold, LÖVE, Bevy), use sprite sheets:

```bash
node tools/render.mjs ice/frost-nova --sheet
```

That writes a transparent PNG of every frame in a grid and an Aseprite-style JSON (frame rects, durations, and
`meta.pixelfx` with fps, loop, columns and the pivot). Phaser's atlas loader and the Aseprite importers for Godot
and Unity read it. `node tools/sheets.mjs` exports the whole library to `sheets/`.

Any effect takes a `palette` (a dark-to-bright ramp of hex colors), so a fire can burn blue and a heal can glow
pink without touching its code:

```bash
node tools/render.mjs fire/torch --gif --opts '{"palette": ["#102","#215","#43a","#8cf","#cff","#fff"]}'
```

## the skill.

The `pixelfx` skill teaches Claude Code to find, use, export and make effects. Install it as a plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add patch-gg/pixelfx
/plugin install pixelfx@pixelfx
```

or copy `skills/pixelfx` into `~/.claude/skills/`. Then ask for what you want:

- "Add a frost nova to my mage's ultimate."
- "Make five takes on a coin pickup sparkle and show me the best two."
- "Export the fire and explosions categories as sprite sheets for Godot."
- "This hit effect feels floaty. Make it punchier."

## make your own.

```bash
node tools/new.mjs arcane/my-spell       # a working starting point (add --loop for a loop)
node tools/render.mjs arcane/my-spell    # records/arcane/my-spell/contact.png: look at it
node tools/check.mjs arcane/my-spell     # spills, seams, unseeded randomness, slow frames
```

Then go round: look at the contact sheet, fix the worst thing, render again. `--gif` and `--mp4` show the motion,
`--all` shows every frame. [docs/AUTHORING.md](docs/AUTHORING.md) has the contract, the drawing API and the quality
bar. `node tools/serve.mjs` runs the gallery locally with your effects in it.

## how it works.

- **Two kinds of effect, no images.** Pure effects export `draw(p, t, o)`, the frame at `t` seconds from `t` alone, so
  loops tile with no seam. Simulated effects export `create(o)` and step real particles, debris and lights at 120 Hz,
  so sparks bounce and smoke rolls the same at any frame rate.
- **Two buffers.** `color` takes pixels: opaque, dithered or truly translucent. `light` takes additive glow, added on
  top. Hot things look hot because of the light buffer.
- **Seeded everything.** Every random number comes from the effect's seed, so frame 40 is the same every time.
- **Local space.** Effects draw around their own origin; the painter places, mirrors and rotates them. Directional
  effects face right. A 24×38 stock character stands in for status effects, auras and hits.
- **Same frame shape as Sprite Fusion's VFX** (`{ w, h, ox, oy, color, light }`), so both libraries can draw into
  one frame.
