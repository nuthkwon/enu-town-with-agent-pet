description: Make pixel art effects and sprite animations in code with the pixelfx library, which has 232 ready-made ones (fire, explosions, water, ice, lightning, sci-fi, melee, impacts, projectiles, spawn and death, arcane, holy, shadow, status, nature, weather, UI, pickups, transitions, critters) to drop into a game, recolor, export as sprite sheets or remix, plus a draft, render, look, refine loop that makes new ones look hand-animated. Use when someone wants pixel art VFX, sprite animations or sprite sheets, game juice, a specific effect ("a frost nova for my mage", "a coin pickup sparkle"), wants to use or export a pixelfx effect in Godot, Unity, Phaser or a canvas game, or wants their pixel effects to look better.

# pixelfx

Pixel art effects as code. Each effect is one file, `src/fx/<category>/<name>.js`, that draws into two buffers:
**color** (pixels: opaque, dithered or truly translucent) and **light** (additive glow). No images, so an effect
can be played live, recolored, mirrored, reseeded and rendered to a sprite sheet for any engine.

The method is Hugo Duprez's ([How to make (good) pixel art effects with
Claude](https://www.spritefusion.com/blog/how-to-make-good-pixel-art-effects-with-claude)): code is clay, trust
your eyes, feed your references. One-shot prompts make mediocre effects. Drafts you render, look at and refine
make good ones.

## Before anything

1. Work in a pixelfx checkout. If the working directory has no `tools/render.mjs`, clone one next to the
   project: `git clone https://github.com/patch-gg/pixelfx`. No install step: the tools use only Node.
2. Check it runs: `node tools/render.mjs fire/torch` writes `records/fire/torch/contact.png`. Open that PNG with
   your image-reading tool. That contact sheet is how you see every effect from now on.

## 1. Look for an existing effect first

`node tools/list.mjs <words>` searches ids, names, tags and descriptions (`node tools/list.mjs frost`,
`node tools/list.mjs slash loop`). `docs/CATALOG.md` lists everything by category. Render the candidates and
look at them before choosing. Most requests are an existing effect with different options:

- `palette`: the main ramp, dark to bright, as hex strings. Any `PAL` ramp in `src/core/color.js` (fire ember
  lava smoke dust ice water electric volt poison holy heal arcane shadow blood earth stone gold leaf wood metal
  bone neon cyber matrix candy night) or your own. A blue fire is `{"palette": PAL.ice}`.
- `seed` for a different but equivalent take; `flip` to face left; `angle` to rotate; `light` (0..1+) for glow
  strength; plus each effect's own knobs in its `meta.options` (size, count, radius, text, height...).
- Try options without editing code: `node tools/render.mjs fire/torch --opts '{"palette":["#102","#215","#43a","#8cf","#fff"]}'`.

## 2. Put it in the game

**Canvas or WebGL games in JS or TS** (plain canvas, Phaser, PixiJS, Kaplay, three.js): use the code directly. It
has no dependencies; copy `src/core` and the effect files you need, or depend on the repo.

```js
import { createFrame, clearFrame, createFx, composite } from "pixelfx";   // src/core/index.js
import * as frostNova from "pixelfx/fx/ice/frost-nova";                   // src/fx/ice/frost-nova.js

const frame = createFrame(320, 180);            // the game's pixel resolution; ox, oy scroll it with the camera
const img = new ImageData(320, 180);
const fx = createFx(frostNova, { x: hero.x, y: hero.y, flip: hero.facing < 0 });

// every tick
fx.update(dt);
clearFrame(frame);
fx.draw(frame, "back");    // what goes behind characters
drawCharacters();          // your own sprites, or draw them into frame.color yourself
fx.draw(frame, "front");
composite(frame, img.data, background);   // color over the background plus light; or null for transparent
ctx.putImageData(img, 0, 0);              // then scale the canvas up with image-rendering: pixelated
if (fx.done()) removeIt();               // one-shots end on their own; fx.stop() fades a loop out
```

Several effects can share one frame. In a WebGL engine, upload the composited RGBA to a texture each frame, or
render the effect to a sprite sheet once (below) and play it like any other animation.

**Any engine** (Godot, Unity, GameMaker, Defold, LÖVE, Bevy, Construct): export sprite sheets.
`node tools/render.mjs ice/frost-nova --sheet` writes `records/ice/frost-nova/frost-nova.png` (transparent
frames in a grid) and `frost-nova.json` (Aseprite-style frames, so Phaser's atlas loader, Godot and Unity Aseprite
importers and most tools read it; `meta.pixelfx` has fps, loop, frame size, columns and the pivot). Set the
pivot to `meta.pixelfx.pivot` (the effect's origin, e.g. the feet), import with nearest-neighbour filtering and no
compression, and play at `meta.pixelfx.fps`. Glow is baked into the sheet as color with alpha, which reads as
additive over dark scenes; for bright scenes, render a recolored version or keep the effect on a dark layer.

For the full library: `node tools/render.mjs <category> --sheet` does a whole category.

## 3. Make a new one

Read `docs/AUTHORING.md` first: it is the contract (meta, `draw(p, t, o)` for pure effects or `create(o)` for
simulated ones, local coordinates, seamless loops, ending empty), the toolkit, the painter API and the quality bar.
Then:

1. **Say it in one line** with art direction: what it is, how it moves, its palette, its timing. "A frost nova:
   crystals erupt in a ring from the feet outward, a white flash at the center, shards spin off, the floor stays
   frosted and fades."
2. **Find references** in the library: `node tools/list.mjs <words>`, then read the two or three closest effect
   files and borrow their techniques (`Particles` and `Bits` in `src/core/sim.js` for sparks, smoke and debris,
   `p.disc` for translucent volumes, `cycle` for seamless particles, `tileFbm` scrolls for flames and water). Look at
   the closest of [Hugo Duprez's effects](https://www.spritefusion.com/pixel-art-vfx) too: they are the quality bar.
   If his has more detail, light or life at the same size on screen, yours isn't done.
3. **Draft.** `node tools/new.mjs <category>/<name>` (add `--loop` for a loop) gives a working file. When the
   direction is open, write 3 to 5 genuinely different drafts (`<name>-a.js` .. `-e.js`), render them all
   (`node tools/render.mjs "<category>/<name>-*"`) and look at every contact sheet before choosing. Show the user
   the strongest two or three if they're around (`--gif` makes animations to share).
4. **Look, judge, fix.** Render, open `records/<id>/contact.png`, and judge like a picky pixel artist. Fix the
   worst thing, render again. Three rounds minimum; a showpiece takes more. `--all` shows every frame,
   `--mp4` shows motion at full speed.
5. **Check.** `node tools/check.mjs <id>` catches drawing outside the canvas, one-shots that don't end empty,
   loop seams, unseeded randomness and slow frames. Fix until it passes clean. Delete the drafts you didn't keep.

What to look for, and the usual fix:

| you see | fix |
|---|---|
| it reads as mush at 1x | fewer colors, a clear silhouette, one focal point, bigger shapes |
| speckle: lone noise pixels inside shapes | threshold noise less, quantize with `at()`, no noise on small shapes |
| floaty, no punch | fast in, slow out (`ease.outQuart`/`outExpo`), a 1 to 2 frame white hero frame, shorter total time |
| stiff or mechanical | vary every particle (size, speed, delay, life), add secondary motion (sparks, smoke, debris) |
| washed out | less glow (k 0.2 to 0.5), darker edge steps, keep white for the hottest core only |
| flat | light from one side: brighter top-left, darker bottom-right step; a darker ramp step at the base |
| smooth gradients, vector look | hard ramp steps in color; softness only in light and in translucent smoke |
| a checkerboard where smoke should be | `SMOKE`, `VAPOUR` or `DUST` particles, or `p.disc`: truly translucent, lit on top |
| seam when a loop wraps | `cycle`, `loopNoise(phase)`, whole-cell `tileNoise` scrolls, `sin(phase * TAU * n)` |
| a one-shot that pops off | let it shrink, dither out or fall away before t = duration |

Directional effects face right, ground effects stand on y = 0, actor effects wrap `o.actor` (a 24 x 38 stock
character's mask and pixels), and nothing uses `Math.random`. Generic motifs are fine; never recreate a specific game's
sprites, characters or logos.

## 4. Native code instead of JS

If the game can't run JS and a sprite sheet isn't enough (an effect that follows a moving target, or needs
per-instance colors at runtime), port the effect. Pure effects are a function of time; simulated ones step the particles in
`src/core/sim.js`. Keep the two-buffer idea, the 4x4 Bayer threshold for dithered alpha and the palette ramp lookups.
Render the JS original and your port side by side to check they match.
